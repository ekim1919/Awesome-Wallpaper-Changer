A bash script designed to make changing the wallpaper for the Awesome windows manager simple. Supports changing wallpapers for multiple monitors (possible to have different wallpaper 
for each monitor) and supports reverting back to older settings if the change is not seen as fit. Uses an rc.lua file as a template and writes lua statements directly to the rc.lua 
file and replaces the previous rc.lua file with the updated one. Script downloads picture from the internet or copies a picture from the hard drive to a specfic directory so 
awesome wm can use the picture.WARNING: This script requires the gears module which is used in awesome version 3.5 and above.
